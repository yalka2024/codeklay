# Feature De-Prioritization & Sunsetting

## Rationale
To maintain focus and maximize value for our target segments (global teams, enterprises), we are de-prioritizing or sunsetting features that do not directly support our core value propositions: collaboration, extensibility, and enterprise-readiness.

## Features to De-Prioritize or Sunset
- [ ] (Example) Standalone code snippet sharing (not collaborative)
- [ ] (Example) Niche integrations with low adoption
- [ ] (Example) Experimental UI themes not used by enterprise clients
- [ ] (Add more as identified in product review)

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Feature does not support collaboration, extensibility, or enterprise-readiness
- [ ] Feature has low adoption or negative impact on product focus
- [ ] Stakeholders notified and migration path (if needed) communicated
