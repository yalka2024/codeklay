# Open Integrations Policy

## Commitment
CodePal is committed to keeping all APIs and plugin systems open, extensible, and well-documented. We avoid any integrations that lock users in or restrict extensibility.

## Integrations to Remove or Avoid
- [ ] (Example) Proprietary-only cloud storage integrations
- [ ] (Example) Closed-source plugin marketplaces
- [ ] (Add more as identified)

## Best Practices
- Document all APIs and plugin endpoints
- Encourage community contributions
- Provide migration paths for deprecated/removed integrations

## Documentation
- [API Reference](../docs/api.md)
- [Plugin System Guide](../docs/plugins.md)
